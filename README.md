# Signals

An experimental Rx- and RAC-3.0-inspired FRP framework

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

You can install it with the following command:

To integrate SSignalKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SSignalKit', '~> 0.0.4'
